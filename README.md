# Welcome to ParcelLockers! 🚀

ParcelLockers is a minecraft plugin dedicated to incorporating highly practical server function of transfering items across the Minecraft world,
especially on long distances.

## ❗Warning

ParcelLockers is at an early stage of development, and you use it at your own risk.

## ✨ Features
- Place different parcel lockers in different Minecraft worlds and send items to other players.
- Link your Minecraft account with your Discord account and receive notifications about incoming parcels.
- **Nexo support** - Use custom items from the Nexo plugin as parcel locker blocks.
- And much more to come in the future!

## ℹ️ Information

- ParcelLockers *currently* supports only latest Minecraft version.
- Requires **Java 21 or later** to work properly. For older versions of Java, this may affect the functionality of the
  plugin.
- If you have any questions, you can ask us about it on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/FQ7jmGBd6c).

## 🏗️ Compiling JAR from Source

To build ParcelLockers, follow these steps (Make sure you have **JDK 21 or higher**):

```shell
./gradlew shadowJar
```

- The output JAR file will be located at `build/libs`.
- When you build the plugin for the first time, it might take a while to download all the dependencies.
