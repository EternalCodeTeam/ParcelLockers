    <!-- We use this file to compile your plugin to your plugins/ directory
             automatically and use the hot swap (also known as live debug) feature.

             It does not support dependencies easily so the only dependency
             we include here is Foundation. It cannot change Foundation's packages
             so you can only debug one plugin at a time to avoid conflicts. -->

         and edit the two paths below to where your server is located.

         You can simply duplicate them or remove the other one if you want
         to automatically compile your plugin to multiple servers. -->
